## 🚨 Phishing Indicators

1. **Fake Sender Email**  
   - Email used: `support@paypa1.com`  
   - The domain is **not** `paypal.com`. It uses a typo (`paypa1` instead of `paypal`), which is a classic **email spoofing** tactic.

2. **Urgent and Threatening Language**  
   - Subject and body use urgent language like:  
     _“Your account has been limited”_  
     _“Respond within 24 hours or your account will be closed”_  
   - This is a **social engineering** trick to pressure victims.

3. **Suspicious Link**  
   - URL: `https://paypal-verify-secure-login.com`  
   - It’s made to look like a real PayPal link but is actually a **fake domain**.  
   - Real PayPal links use domains like `paypal.com`.

4. **Generic Greeting**  
   - Uses “Dear Customer” instead of the recipient’s real name.  
   - Real services usually personalize their emails.

5. **Suspicious Attachment**  
   - Filename: `AccountVerificationForm.zip`  
   - ZIP files may contain malware or phishing forms. Never open unsolicited attachments.

6. **Spelling & Grammar**  
   - The tone of the email is robotic and lacks professional language.
